# 🏀 1v1 Basketball Game (Flask + Python)

Welcome to the **1v1 Basketball Game Web App**, a turn-based basketball simulation game built with **Python**, **Flask**, and **JavaScript**.

This project was created as a hands-on way to practice **DevOps**, **Infrastructure as Code**, and **cloud-native deployment using Azure**. It is actively evolving from a simple demo into an enterprise-level, production-ready web application.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- ✅ Build a turn-based 1v1 basketball game with player vs CPU mechanics
- ✅ Use Flask for backend game logic
- ✅ Build a dynamic front end with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- ✅ Practice CI/CD and DevOps concepts
- ✅ Deploy using Azure services (App Service, Azure SQL, etc.)
- 🚀 Implement IaC using **Terraform**
- 📊 Add a leaderboard feature backed by a database
- 🎧 Add sound effects and animations
- 🔐 Practice secure coding and app hardening
